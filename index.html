            Waste management and e waste data's from the year of 2000 to 2023 
            <p>Sources: statista.com (1) stats.oecd.org (2) ewastemonitor.info (3) ewastemonitor.info (4) Here is a summary of waste management and e-waste data from the year 2000 to 2023:
                In the year 2000, e-waste was 20 million tonnes per year. 2014, it had grown to 41.8 million tonnes per.
                A United Nations University report estimates that e-waste will more than double by 2050, reaching approximately 111 million tonnes per year.
                In 2019, 78 countries had e-waste policies, legislation, or regulation, covering some 71% of the world's population. However, enforcement of legislation in some countries is poor or
                non-existent.

                49,880 million in 2020 and is projected to almost triple to 143,870 million by 2028.
                In 2021, the global e-waste generation was estimated to be around 57.4 million metric tonnes, with an annual increase since data was first collected in 2014.
                Since 2014, up until the end of 2022, there will have been an estimated total of 420.3 Million Metric Tonnes of e-waste produced.
                It is estimated that at least 347 Mt of e-waste remains on the planet, although this is likely to be a conservative estimate.
                Global electronic waste volume is projected to grow to 74.7 Mt by 2030, meaning it will have almost doubled in only 16 years.
                Asia (24.9 Mt), the Americas (13.1 Mt), and Europe (12Mt) produced the overwhelming majority of e-waste when measured by total weight.
                When measured per capita, Europeans (16.2 Kg) produce the most e-waste, followed by the Americas (13.3 Kg), Asia (5.6 Kg), and Africa (2.5 Kg).
                According to the European Commission, the plastic waste generated in 2023 is expected to be around 13.4 million tonnes.
                E-waste is expected to grow rapidly. According to a United Nations report, 55.3 million tonnes of e-waste was generated globally in 2020. It is projected to grow to 111 million tonnes by 2050.
                Non-biodegradable waste includes plastics, metals, and synthetic fibers. The United Nations report also indicates that 24% of plastic waste generated in 2020 was non-biodegradable.
                These data indicate that plastic waste, e-waste, and non-biodegradable waste have become significant environmental challenges in recent years.
                
                Remember that this data is based on estimates and projections, and the actual figures may vary. Additionally, these data are global estimates and may vary significantly based on regional factors and practices.
                
                In India, the scenario is slightly different due to varying factors like manufacturing, consumer behavior, and government policies.
                 
                
                According to a report by the International Resource Panel, India generated approximately 6.3 million tonnes of plastic waste in 2020. However, as plastic consumption in India continues to rise, the country's plastic waste generation is also expected to increase.
                
                The recycling of e-waste in India has gained momentum in recent years. However, due to a lack of regulations and proper infrastructure, most e-waste is disposed of informally, posing a significant environmental threat. According to the e-waste monitoring project in India, approximately 30.4 metric tons of e-waste were collected for recycling in 2020.
                
                The quantity of non-biodegradable waste generated in India is not directly available. However, based on global estimates and practices, it can be inferred that non-biodegradable waste in India contributes significantly to environmental degradation.
                
                It is important to note that these data are based on estimates and projections and may vary depending on the actual practices and policies implemented by the Indian government.
